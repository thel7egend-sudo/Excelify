# Excelify

A desktop spreadsheet-like application built with Python and PySide6.

Status: Active development.

- You can use other libraries if benefitial for the app,BUT ASK ME BEFORE HAND. 
- The app is specifically made for freelancers as our 1st niche moreover Data Entry Freelancers working with excel.
- The app is just made for the purpose making the Data Entry Process the most smooth and productive it then provides a simple excel export so the user can later do excel heavy tasks there itself as they are used to excel and excel has a lot features and they work fine too. 
- So for now at least it isnt our goal to replace excel or make something better but we need to make an environment that is better in terms of data entry experience than that of excel's.
